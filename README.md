## Project Description
**Trace AI** is a smart note-taking application that helps users refine and organize their notes efficiently. The app allows users to input their rough notes in one window, while an AI-based engine works in another window to clean, format, and summarize the content for better readability and organization. This project combines the power of AI with a user-friendly interface to make the note-taking process more streamlined and effective.

### Why is it important or interesting to you?
Note-taking is a crucial skill for students and professionals alike. However, many people struggle to keep their notes organized or formatted in a way that is easy to review. With **Trace AI**, we aim to make note-taking more efficient by leveraging AI to clean and refine notes automatically, allowing users to focus on the content rather than formatting. The project is particularly interesting because it merges AI technologies with real-world applications in education and productivity. It also provides the team with hands-on experience in working with cutting-edge technologies.

### What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?
- **Languages**: 
  - TypeScript: Ensures type safety and scalable code.
  
- **Frameworks**:
  - Next.js: A React-based framework with server-side rendering capabilities. This will enhance the performance of our app and improve SEO. Additionally, Next.js allows easy API creation, which is essential for our AI integration.
  
- **Authentication**:
  - NextAuth: Used for user authentication to secure personal notes and enable features such as user profiles and saving preferences. NextAuth integrates seamlessly with Next.js and supports various providers like Google, GitHub, and custom email/password.

- **Styling**:
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that will allow us to build a responsive and modern UI quickly. Its flexibility and built-in utilities will make the design process more efficient.

- **AI**:
  - Google’s Gemini API: We chose Google’s Gemini API for natural language processing because it offers powerful, efficient, and customizable models for text refinement, summarization, and understanding. It’s also highly reliable and backed by Google’s extensive research in AI.

- **Project Tools**:
  - GitHub for version control and collaboration.
  - GitHub Projects for task management.

### What will be the input/output of your project?
- **Input**: 
  - User’s raw notes, either typed or pasted into the input window.
  - User preferences for how refined they want the output (e.g., summarized, formatted, etc.)
  
- **Output**: 
  - A cleaner, more organized version of the input notes in the output window.

### Features of Trace AI
- Real-time note refinement using AI
- Summarization and keyword extraction
- Customizable formatting options (e.g., headers, bullet points, etc.)
- Authentication using NextAuth to secure user notes
- Export options for refined notes (e.g., PDF, Markdown)
- User-friendly interface with two windows: one for input and one for the AI-refined output
- Integration with popular note-taking apps (stretch goal)

## Project Complexity
The complexity of the project is appropriate for the timeline and the team size. We will be building both a user-facing interface and an AI backend, involving the integration of several technologies, including natural language processing models, secure authentication, and front-end frameworks. Each team member will be responsible for different components (e.g., frontend, backend, AI model integration), ensuring a balanced workload.
