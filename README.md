## Project Description

**Trace AI** is a smart note-taking application that helps users refine and organize their notes efficiently. The app allows users to input their rough notes in one window, while an AI-based engine works in another window to clean, format, and summarize the content for better readability and organization. This project combines the power of AI with a user-friendly interface to make the note-taking process more streamlined and effective.

### Why is it important or interesting to you?

Note-taking is a crucial skill for students and professionals alike. However, many people struggle to keep their notes organized or formatted in a way that is easy to review. With **Trace AI**, we aim to make note-taking more efficient by leveraging AI to clean and refine notes automatically, allowing users to focus on the content rather than formatting. The project is particularly interesting because it merges AI technologies with real-world applications in education and productivity. It also provides the team with hands-on experience in working with cutting-edge technologies.

### What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?

- **Languages**:

  - TypeScript: Ensures type safety and scalable code.

- **Frameworks**:

  - Next.js: A React-based framework with server-side rendering capabilities. This will enhance the performance of our app and improve SEO. Additionally, Next.js allows easy API creation, which is essential for our AI integration.

- **Authentication**:

  - **Clerk**: Used for user authentication and management. Clerk provides secure access to personal notes and features such as user profiles and saved preferences. It integrates well with Next.js and offers real-time capabilities.

- **Styling**:

  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that will allow us to build a responsive and modern UI quickly. Its flexibility and built-in utilities will make the design process more efficient.

- **AI**:

  - **OpenAI API**: We chose OpenAI's API for natural language processing because it offers powerful, efficient, and customizable models for text refinement, summarization, and understanding. It’s highly reliable and widely recognized for its capabilities in AI.

- **Project Tools**:
  - GitHub for version control and collaboration.
  - GitHub Projects for task management.

### What will be the input/output of your project?

- **Input**:

  - User’s raw notes, either typed or pasted into the input window.
  - User preferences for how refined they want the output (e.g., summarized, formatted, etc.)

- **Output**:
  - A cleaner, more organized version of the input notes in the output window.

### Features of Trace AI

- Real-time note refinement using AI
- Summarization and keyword extraction
- Customizable formatting options (e.g., headers, bullet points, etc.)
- Authentication and data management using Clerk to secure user notes
- Export options for refined notes (e.g., PDF, Markdown)
- User-friendly interface with two windows: one for input and one for the AI-refined output
- Integration with popular note-taking apps (stretch goal)

## Project Complexity

The complexity of the project is appropriate for the timeline and the team size. We will be building both a user-facing interface and an AI backend, involving the integration of several technologies, including natural language processing models, secure authentication, and front-end frameworks. Each team member will be responsible for different components (e.g., frontend, backend, AI model integration), ensuring a balanced workload.

## Project Workflow

Every issue or task in Trace AI will pass through the following stages before deployment:

1. **Backlog**: All planned features and tasks start here. This includes ideas, suggestions, and features that are not yet prioritized for immediate work.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: Features and tasks selected for the current sprint are moved here. These are the tasks that the team has committed to work on during the sprint cycle.
3. **In Development**: Active development occurs in this stage. Once the task is being worked on, it moves from the sprint backlog to this stage.
4. **In Testing**: After development, the task is moved here for testing. This can involve unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to ensure functionality works as expected.
5. **Deployment**: Once a task or feature passes testing, it is moved to deployment, where it is released to production.

This workflow helps to ensure a structured, consistent, and high-quality development process.
