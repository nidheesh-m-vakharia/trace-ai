        Trace AI is a smart note-taking application that helps users refine and
        organize their notes efficiently. The app allows users to input their
        rough notes in one window, while an AI-based engine works in another
        window to clean, format, and summarize the content for better
        readability and organization. This project combines the power of AI with
        a user-friendly interface to make the note-taking process more
        streamlined and effective.

        Note-taking is a crucial skill for students and professionals alike.
        However, many people struggle to keep their notes organized or formatted
        in a way that is easy to review. With Trace AI, we aim to make
        note-taking more efficient by leveraging AI to clean and refine notes
        automatically, allowing users to focus on the content rather than
        formatting. The project is particularly interesting because it merges AI
        technologies with real-world applications in education and productivity.
        It also provides the team with hands-on experience in working with
        cutting-edge technologies.
