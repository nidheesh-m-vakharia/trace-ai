          Trace AI is a smart note-taking application that helps users refine
          and organize their notes efficiently. The app allows users to input
          their rough notes in one window, while an AI-based engine works in
          another window to clean, format, and summarize the content for better
          readability and organization. This project combines the power of AI
          with a user-friendly interface to make the note-taking process more
          streamlined and effective.

        <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <h5 className="font-bold">
          Note-taking is a crucial skill for students and professionals alike.
          However, many people struggle to keep their notes organized or
          formatted in a way that is easy to review. With Trace AI, we aim to
          make note-taking more efficient by leveraging AI to clean and refine
          notes automatically, allowing users to focus on the content rather
          than formatting. The project is particularly interesting because it
          merges AI technologies with real-world applications in education and
          productivity. It also provides the team with hands-on experience in
          working with cutting-edge technologies.
